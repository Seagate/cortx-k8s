# Contribute to the CORTX Project

CORTX is about building the world's best scalable mass-capacity object storage system. If you’re interested in what we’re building and intrigued by hard challenges, here's everything you need to know about contributing to the project and how to get started. 

This guide is intended to provide quick start instructions for developers who want to build, test, and contribute to the CORTX software running on Kubernetes.

After reading this guide, you'll be able to pick up topics and issues to contribute, submit your code, and how to turn your pull request into a successful contribution. And if you have any suggestions on how we can improve this guide, or anything else in the project, we want to hear from you!

## Code of Conduct

Thanks for joining us and we're glad to have you. We take community very seriously and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity as documented in our [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

You can report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by contacting the project team at opensource@seagate.com.

## Deployment and Testing
- Learn various methods to acquire, build, run and test CORTX on Kubernetes in the [Quick Start Guides](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s#quick-starts) section of our [README](README.md).

## Repository Overview

### Branches

- `main`: The primary branch for the repository. This branch will be the source for all `cortx-k8s` releases and is managed only by the [Maintainers](#maintainers) of the repository.
- `integration`: This branch does the bulk of the heavy lifting for the `cortx-k8s` project, as it is the target for all Pull Requests - both internal to the repository and external from forked repositories. Maintainers of the repository merge from `integration` to `main` to control the release flow of the repository.
- `cortx-test`: An internal development-focused branch to stage breaking changes, while allowing the larger community to test CORTX in motion.
- `CORTX-12345...`: Branches with the format of `CORTX-12345` are feature branches that are actively being worked upon by contributors and will eventually be PR'ed into `integration` once complete. Due to historical changes in tooling, feature branches may also begin with `EOS` or `UDX` as well. 

## Contribution Process

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are all available in the root [CORTX](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx) repository:

- Please read the [CORTX Code Style Guide](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/CodeStyle.md).
- Get started with [GitHub Tools and Procedures](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/GitHub_Processes_and_Tools.rst), if you are new to GitHub.
   - Please find additional information about [working with git](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/working_with_git.md) specific to CORTX.
- Please read about our [DCO and CLA policies](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/dco_cla.md) in the root [CORTX](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx) repository.

### Submitting a PR

This compact flow for submitting a Pull Request to the [cortx-k8s](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s) repository will help ensure that it is able to be accepted and merged with minimal overhead or editing. 

> :warning: The target branch of your Pull Request should be the default **`integration`** branch

1. Setup your work environment, starting from the initial repository
    - [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s/fork) to another personal or organization account on GitHub.
    - Clone the forked repository locally.
    - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s`

2. Create a work branch starting from the default `integration` branch.
   - `git checkout -b my_work_branch integration`

3. Do your work, including writing code, writing tests, updating documentation, and passing all tests locally.
   - Edit files...
   - `git add ...`
   - `git commit -s -m "My commit message" # commit with sign-off`

4. Create a pull request from your `my_work_branch` against the upstream [**integration**](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s/tree/integration) branch.
   - `git push origin my_work_branch`
   - Submit Pull Request from GitHub with this repository's `integration` branch as the target branch.
   - _Reference:_ [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

5. Make updates based on code reviews (if needed)
   - Edit files
   - `git add ...`
   - `git commit -s -m "My updated commit message" # commit with sign-off`
   - `git push origin my_work_branch`

6. Rebasing the work branch for changes that take longer (if needed)
   - `git checkout integration`
   - `git pull upstream`
   - `git checkout my_work_branch`
   - `git rebase integration`
   - `git push origin my_work_branch`
   - _NOTE: This is usually only required when changes have been delivered to the `upstream/integration` branch since you created your working branch_

7. Your PR will be reviewed, inspected, and (if appropriate) automatically tested using integrated CI/CD workflows. Once complete, project maintainers will accept the PR and merge the code changes into the `integration` branch.

8. Congratulations! You have now successfully contributed to making the CORTX project even better!
